    The taste reminds you of Costco cookies...looks like you're alive for now. When you look up from your cookie, you notice a figure you recognize quickly run past the alleyway. You decide to...
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="chase.html">Run after the figure in hope of catching them.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="Costco.html"> Go to Costco to get more cookies, as your hunger cannot be sated by only one sacrifice.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="Sleep.html"> Ignore the figure and take a nap in the suspicious alleyway.</a> Who needs curiousity when you have a nice pillow of hard concrete.
